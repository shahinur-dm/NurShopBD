      "When a motor, contactor, sensor or bearing fails, the job is not “buy any spare” — it is match rating, fit and duty so the line starts again the same day.",
    problem:
      "Most unplanned stops in small Bangladeshi workshops are not new-machine problems. A nameplate is faded, the original brand is gone, or the store sold a look-alike that does not fit the shaft, coil voltage or sensing distance. Hours are lost on trial parts. The operator needs a working equivalent, not a catalogue screenshot.",

      "We treat spare supply as an engineering match. Send a photo, nameplate, part number or the failed unit. We cross-check kW/HP, voltage, frame, I/O type (NPN/PNP), coil voltage and mounting, then quote OEM or a documented compatible.

Proximity and photoelectric sensors handle presence and counting. A compact PLC (Delta, Siemens S7-1200, Mitsubishi FX, Omron CP1E) sequences start, stop, jam and reject.
